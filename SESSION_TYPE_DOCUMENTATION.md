# Session Type Display Changes - Documentation Summary

**Date**: December 2024  
**Issue**: Session type badge changes only appeared on one page  
**Root Cause**: Homepage and Prompts page use different card rendering systems  

## 🎯 What Was Done

### 1. **Identified the Issue**
- Changes were made to `PromptCard.tsx` (used only on `/prompts` page)
- Homepage (`/`) uses inline card rendering in `Index.tsx`
- Both needed to be updated separately

### 2. **Applied Session Type Changes**
- **Cards**: "Instant Output" → "Instant ⚡" (with Zap icon)
- **Cards**: "Step-by-Step Flow" → "Step-by-Step" (text only)
- **Modals**: Keep full text unchanged
- **Tooltips**: Removed broken hover tooltips from cards

### 3. **Updated Both Systems**
- **Homepage**: `src/pages/Index.tsx` (lines ~25 & ~405)
- **Prompts Page**: `src/components/PromptCard.tsx` (lines ~67 & ~100)

### 4. **Comprehensive Documentation**
Created multiple documentation layers to prevent future confusion:

#### **📄 Files Created/Updated:**
1. **`CARD_ARCHITECTURE.md`** - Complete developer guide
2. **`PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`** - Updated with architecture warning
3. **`CURRENT_STATUS.md`** - Added critical warnings
4. **`README.md`** - Added developer reference
5. **Code Comments** - Added warnings in both files

#### **🔍 Key Documentation Points:**
- Clear explanation of dual card systems
- Line number references for quick navigation  
- Warning comments directly in code
- Checklist for future changes
- Common mistakes to avoid

## ✅ **Result**

- **Homepage**: Shows "Instant ⚡" and "Step-by-Step" badges ✅
- **Prompts Page**: Shows "Instant ⚡" and "Step-by-Step" badges ✅
- **Modals**: Show full text with tooltips ✅
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides prevent future issues ✅

## 📚 **For Future Developers**

**When changing card appearance:**
1. Check `CARD_ARCHITECTURE.md` first
2. Update both `Index.tsx` AND `PromptCard.tsx`  
3. Test both `/` and `/prompts` routes
4. Look for warning comments in the code

**Quick Reference:**
- Homepage cards: `src/pages/Index.tsx` line ~405
- Prompts cards: `src/components/PromptCard.tsx`
- Complete guide: `CARD_ARCHITECTURE.md`

This issue highlighted the importance of comprehensive documentation for architectural decisions that aren't immediately obvious from the codebase structure.
