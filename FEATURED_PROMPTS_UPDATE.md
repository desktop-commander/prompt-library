# ‚úÖ Featured Prompts Implementation

**Date**: September 2, 2025  
**Status**: COMPLETED  

## üéØ Implementation Summary

### Feature Overview
Implemented featured prompts functionality that prioritizes 9 specific prompts when users open the library with no filters applied or select "for all" in both filter categories.

### Featured Prompts List
The following prompts are now featured in order:

1. **Organise my Downloads folder** (ID: 8)
2. **Explain Codebase or Repository** (ID: 59) 
3. **Build A Feature from Scratch** (ID: 2)
4. **Set Up WordPress Environment** (ID: 55)
5. **Set Up Cloud Infrastructure** (ID: 53)
6. **Build and Deploy Landing Page** (ID: 82)
7. **Generate Docker Configuration** (ID: 78)
8. **Set Up Local Development Environment** (ID: 4)
9. **Extract Data from PDFs** (ID: 43)

## üîß Technical Implementation

### File Modified
- **`src/pages/Prompts.tsx`**: Added featured prompts logic to filtering and sorting system

### Code Changes

#### 1. Added Featured Prompts Array
```typescript
// Featured prompts - shown first when no filters are applied
const featuredPromptIds = ['8', '59', '2', '55', '53', '82', '78', '4', '43'];
```

#### 2. Enhanced Filtering Logic
Added logic to detect when no filters are applied:
```typescript
const noFiltersApplied = searchTerm === '' && 
                       selectedCategories.length === 0 && 
                       selectedRoles.length === 0 && 
                       selectedSessionTypes.length === 0;
```

#### 3. Modified Sorting Algorithm
Enhanced sorting to prioritize featured prompts:
- When no filters applied: Featured prompts appear first in specified order
- When filters applied: Regular sorting behavior (popularity, alphabetical, etc.)
- Featured prompts maintain their order relative to each other
- Non-featured prompts sort normally after featured ones

### Logic Flow

1. **Filter Detection**: Check if any filters are active (search term, categories, roles, session types)
2. **Featured Prioritization**: If no filters applied, sort featured prompts to the top in specified order
3. **Regular Sorting**: Apply standard sorting (popularity/alphabetical/etc.) to remaining prompts
4. **Mixed Results**: Featured prompts first, then other prompts sorted by selected criteria

## üìã Behavior Details

### When Featured Prompts Show
- ‚úÖ Open library page with no filters
- ‚úÖ Clear all filters using "Clear Filters" button  
- ‚úÖ No search term entered
- ‚úÖ No categories selected
- ‚úÖ No roles selected (or "For All" equivalent)
- ‚úÖ No session types selected

### When Regular Sorting Takes Over
- ‚ùå Any search term entered
- ‚ùå Any category filter selected
- ‚ùå Any role filter selected  
- ‚ùå Any session type filter selected
- ‚ùå Any combination of the above

### Sort Order Interaction
- **No filters + "Most Popular"**: Featured first, then by popularity
- **No filters + "Alphabetical"**: Featured first, then alphabetical
- **No filters + "Session Type"**: Featured first, then by session type
- **No filters + "Recently Added"**: Featured first, then by date

## ‚úÖ User Experience Impact

### Improved Discovery
- New users see curated, high-value prompts immediately
- No learning curve required to find useful prompts
- Balanced selection covering different use cases and roles

### Maintained Functionality  
- All existing filter and search functionality preserved
- Users can still find any prompt using existing methods
- Featured prompts don't interfere with specific searches

### Progressive Enhancement
- Default experience showcases best prompts
- Power users can still use advanced filtering
- Featured prompts provide good starting point for exploration

## üéâ Implementation Complete
