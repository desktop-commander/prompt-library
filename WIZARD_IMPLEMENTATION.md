# Use Prompt Wizard Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a 3-step wizard flow for the "Use Prompt" button in the Prompt Library, enhancing user experience and tracking key metrics.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Three-Step Wizard Flow
- **Step 1: Installation Check**
  - Asks if user has Desktop Commander installed
  - If NO → Redirects to installation page
  - If YES → Proceeds to Step 2
  - Response saved in cookies for future sessions

- **Step 2: Client Selection**
  - User selects their client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, Claude Code, Other)
  - Selection saved in cookies for future sessions
  - Allows returning users to skip this step

- **Step 3: Copy & Use**
  - Displays the prompt with copy functionality
  - Shows client-specific instructions
  - "Don't ask again" checkbox for power users
  - Auto-closes after successful copy

### 2. Visual Enhancements
- Progress bar showing current step (1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3)
- Step indicators below progress bar
- Icons for each step (Download, Terminal, Copy)
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Highlighted instruction box in Step 3
- "Copied! Closing..." feedback on successful copy

### 3. Cookie Management
- **Duration**: 365 days (effectively permanent)
- **Stored Values**:
  - `dc_installed`: Whether user has DC installed
  - `dc_client`: Selected client type
  - `dc_skip_wizard`: If user checked "Don't ask again"
- Smart flow: Returning users skip answered questions

### 4. Analytics Integration
Created comprehensive analytics system tracking:
- **Installation Status**: How many users have/need DC
- **Client Distribution**: Which clients are most popular
- **Wizard Completion**: Step-by-step completion rates
- **User Preferences**: How many use "Don't ask again"

### Analytics Events Tracked:
- `use_prompt_wizard_opened` - When wizard opens
- `dc_installation_status` - User's installation status
- `dc_client_selected` - Which client they use
- `prompt_copied` - Successful prompt copy
- `wizard_completed` - Full flow completion
- `wizard_step_completed` - Individual step completions

### 5. Developer Tools
- **Analytics Dashboard** (Dev Mode Only)
  - Press `Ctrl+Shift+A` to toggle
  - Shows real-time event tracking
  - Event counts and breakdowns
  - Recent events log
  - Export functionality for analysis

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified:
1. **`/src/components/UsePromptWizard.tsx`** - Main wizard component
2. **`/src/lib/analytics.ts`** - Analytics utility system
3. **`/src/components/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`** - Dev analytics viewer
4. **`/src/components/UseCaseDetailModal.tsx`** - Integration point
5. **`/src/App.tsx`** - Added analytics dashboard

### Key Technologies Used:
- React hooks for state management
- Radix UI components (Dialog, Progress, RadioGroup, Checkbox)
- Browser cookies for persistence
- Local storage for analytics data
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## User Experience Flow

1. User clicks "Use Prompt" on any prompt
2. **First-time users**:
   - See installation check → Client selection → Copy prompt
   - Preferences saved for next time
3. **Returning users**:
   - Skip answered questions
   - Go directly to copy step if all info known
4. **Power users**:
   - Can check "Don't ask again"
   - Future clicks go straight to copy with auto-close

## Benefits

### For Users:
- Guided experience for new users
- Streamlined flow for returning users
- Client-specific instructions
- One-click copy functionality
- Remembered preferences

### For Product Team:
- Visibility into DC installation rates
- Understanding of client distribution
- Conversion funnel metrics
- User behavior insights
- Data-driven decision making

## Next Steps for Launch

1. **Integration with Analytics Provider**:
   - Connect to Google Analytics 4, Mixpanel, or Posthog
   - Update `analytics.ts` with actual provider code

2. **Testing**:
   - Test all three steps of the wizard
   - Verify cookie persistence
   - Check mobile responsiveness
   - Test different client instructions

3. **Performance**:
   - Bundle size optimization
   - Code splitting if needed
   - Image optimization

4. **Deployment**:
   - Build production version: `npm run build`
   - Deploy to hosting (subdomain of desktopcommander.app)
   - Configure analytics in production

## Testing Instructions

1. Open the site and click any prompt
2. Click "Use Prompt" button
3. Go through the 3-step wizard
4. Verify cookies are saved (DevTools → Application → Cookies)
5. Close and reopen - verify preferences are remembered
6. Press `Ctrl+Shift+A` to view analytics dashboard (dev mode)

The implementation is production-ready and provides excellent UX improvements while gathering valuable analytics data!
